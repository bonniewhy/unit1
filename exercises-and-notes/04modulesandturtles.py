# EXERCISES --------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1. Write a program that prints "We like Python's turtles!" 1000 times.
# 
# Now, update that program to prompt the user for an integer and then print the
# same message the given number of times.
# 
# 2. Write a program that prints out the lyrics to the song "99 Bottles of Beer
# on the Wall"
# 
# 3. Write a program that prints even integers from 0 to 50.
# 
# 4. Write a program that uses a for loop to print:
#   One of the months of the year is January
#   One of the months of the year is February
#   One of the months of the year is March
#   etc...
# 
# 5. Use for loops to make a turtle draw these regular polygons (regular means
# all sides are the same length, all angles the same): 
# --- An equilateral triangle
# --- A square
# --- A hexagon (six sides)
# --- An octagon (eight sides)
# 
# 6. Write a program that asks the user for the number of sides, the length of the
# side, the color, and the fill color of a regular polygon.
# 
# 7. A drunk pirate makes a random turn and then takes 100 steps forward, makes
# another random turn, takes another 100 steps, turns another random amont, etc. A
# social science student records the angle of each turn before the next 100 steps
# are taken. Her experimental data is: 160, -43, 270, -97, -43, 200, -940, 17, -86.
# Positive angles are counter-clockwise). Use a turtle to draw the path taken by
# our drunk friend.
# 
# 8. On a piece of scratch paper, trace the path of the following turtle in the
# following program. When you are done, press run and check your answer.
# 
#import turtle
#wn = turtle.Screen()
#tess = turtle.Turtle()
#tess.speed(5)
#tess.right(90)
#tess.left(36000)
#tess.right(-90)
#tess.left(36000)
#tess.forward(-100)
# 
# 9. Write a program to draw a five pointed star.
# 
# 10. Write a program to draw a face of a clock that looks like the example in the
# textbook.
# 
# 11. Write a program to draw some kind of picture. Be creative and experiment with
# the turtle methods provided in Summary of Turtle Methods.
# 
# 12. Create a turtle and assign it to a variable. When you print its type, what do
# you get?
# 
# 13. A sprite is a simple spider shaped thing with n legs coming out from a center
# point. The angle between each leg is 360 / n degrees.
# Write a program to draw a sprite where the number of legs is provided by the user:
# 
# 14. Use a for statement to print 10 random numbers.
# 
# 15. Repeate the above exercise, but this time print 10 random numbers between
# 25 and 35.
# 
# 16. The Pythagorean Theorem tells us that the length of the hypotenuse of a right
# triangle is related to the lengths of the other two sides. Look through the math
# module and see if you can find a function that will compute this relationship for
# you. Once you find it, write a short program to try it out.
# 
# 17. Search on the internet for a way to calculate an approximation for pi. There
# are many that use simple arithmetic. Write a program to computer the approximation
# and then print the value as well as the value of math.pi from the math module.)
