# WEEKLY GRADED ASSIGNMENT -----------------------------------------------------
# Assume you have a list of numbers nums = [12, 10, 32, 3, 66, 17, 42, 99, 20]
# 
# a. Write a loop that prints each of the numbers on a new line, like this:
# 12
# 10
# ... etc.
# 
# b. Write a second loop that prints each number and its square on a new line,
# precisely like this:
# 
# The square of 12 is 144
# The square of 10 is 100
# ... etc.

nums = [12, 10, 32, 3, 66, 17, 42, 99, 20]
